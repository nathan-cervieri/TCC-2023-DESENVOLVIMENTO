14/08 -> 5h: Reorganizing project and separating parts of code for easier look around
15/08 -> 3h: Class
17/08 -> 3h: Meeting with professor, finished deciding on method and started test development
18/08 -> 3h: Continued testing development, trouble deciding on non optimal case
19/08 -> 6h: Mulled over optimal case, tested different hipotesis, decided on multiple find replace for each "change"
